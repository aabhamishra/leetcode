## Intuition
- The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses, brackets, and curly braces encountered in the string.
- When a closing character is encountered, it is checked against the top of the stack to ensure a matching opening character.
- If the stack is empty or the top of the stack doesn't match, the string contains invalid parentheses.

## Approach
1. Initialize an empty list `stack` to act as a stack for storing opening parentheses, brackets, and curly braces.
2. Iterate through each character `c` in the input string `s`:
   - If `c` is an opening parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace ('(', '[', '{'), push it onto the stack.
   - If `c` is a closing parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace (')', ']', '}'):
     - Check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the corresponding opening character.
     - If either condition is true, return `False` since the parentheses are not valid.
     - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.
3. After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty:
   - If the stack is empty, all parentheses are valid, and the function returns `True`.
   - If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening parentheses, and the function returns `False`.

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string once, performing constant-time operations. The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string.

## Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses additional space for the stack and other variables. The space complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        stack = [] 
        for c in s: 
            if c in '([{': 
                stack.append(c) 
            else: 
                if not stack or \
                    (c == ')' and stack[-1] != '(') or \
                    (c == '}' and stack[-1] != '{') or \
                    (c == ']' and stack[-1] != '['):
                    return False 
                stack.pop() 
        return not stack 
```
