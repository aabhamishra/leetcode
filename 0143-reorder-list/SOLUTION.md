## Intuition
The problem involves reordering a singly-linked list in-place. The goal is to modify the linked list such that the nodes are reordered to form a pattern where the first node is followed by the last node, the second node is followed by the second-to-last node, and so on.

## Approach

The algorithm follows a three-step approach to reorder the linked list:

1. **Find the Middle**: Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to find the middle of the linked list. Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list. The `slow` pointer will then be at the middle.

2. **Reverse Second Half**: Separate the second half of the list starting from the node after `slow`. Reverse the second half of the list by reversing the direction of the `next` pointers.

3. **Merge Lists Alternately**: Combine the first half and the reversed second half of the list by alternating the nodes. Iterate through the two halves, updating the `next` pointers accordingly.

The modifications are done in-place without returning anything.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the list multiple times but does so in a single pass.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$
The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for pointers (`slow`, `fast`, `second`, `prev`, `tmp`, `tmp1`, and `tmp2`).

**Python**

# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        # define the pointers
        slow, fast = head, head.next

        # iterate so that slow pointer reaches the middle of list 
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # start of second half of list
        second = slow.next
        # first half ends, so point it to None
        slow.next = None

        # reverse second half of list
        prev = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp
        
        # combine lists now in alternate indices
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2             
```
