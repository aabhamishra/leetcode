# LeetCode Daily Dive

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository! üöÄ 

Here, you'll find my daily attempts and solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode. There's a mix of Blind 75 problems, daily challenges, and random picks. 

## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my journey through LeetCode, maintaining a daily discipline of solving at least one problem. It captures my solutions in different programming languages along with detailed explanations. 

Here's a Google Sheets tracker to view problem details more comprehensively: [Leetcode Daily Dive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oJ0PmvIlxgIzH6oE2ROd8KFr4wDH1GXZfoprRPQaxS0/edit?usp=sharing)

Browse through this repo's folders to discover solutions to specific problems. Each problem directory is organized with the following structure:

- **Question:** The original problem statement.
- **Code:** Solutions in various programming languages (Python, Java, etc.).
  - **Solution1.py**
  - **Solution2.java**
  - **...**
- **Explanation:** Detailed breakdown of the approach, intuition, time complexity, and space complexity.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! Your insights and suggestions are always welcome.
