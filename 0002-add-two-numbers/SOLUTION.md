## Intuition
The algorithm below efficiently adds two numbers represented as linked lists by simulating the addition process digit by digit. The `carry` variable keeps track of the carry between digits, and the result is stored in a new linked list.

## Approach

The algorithm follows a straightforward approach to simulate the process of adding two numbers:

1. Initialize a `carry` variable to 0 and create a new linked list with a dummy `head`.
2. Traverse both linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) simultaneously until reaching the end of both.
3. At each step, extract the values of the current nodes in `l1` and `l2` (or use 0 if one of them is `null`).
4. Calculate the sum (`s`) by adding the values of the current nodes and the current `carry`.
5. Update the `carry` as the integer division of `s` by 10.
6. Create a new node in the result linked list with the value being the remainder of `s` divided by 10.
7. Move to the next node in both `l1` and `l2`.
8. Continue this process until reaching the end of both linked lists.
9. If there is a remaining `carry` after the loop, create a new node with the value of the `carry` at the end of the result linked list.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(m)$
The while loop runs as long as either of the lists still has a node. This means that the time complexity depends on the larger list, and should be O(M), where m = number of nodes in the larger list. 

- Space complexity: $O(1)$
O(1) auxiliary space is taken. The size of the returned list depends, again, on the size of the larger of the two input lists. 
## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode curr = head;

        while(l1 != null || l2 != null) {
            int v1 = l1 == null ? 0 : l1.val;
            int v2 = l2 == null ? 0 : l2.val;

            int s = (carry + v1 + v2);
            carry = s / 10;
            curr.next = new ListNode(s % 10);

            curr = curr.next;
            l1 = l1 == null ? null : l1.next;
            l2 = l2 == null ? null : l2.next;
        }

        if(carry != 0) {
            curr.next = new ListNode(carry);
        }
        return head.next;
    }
}
