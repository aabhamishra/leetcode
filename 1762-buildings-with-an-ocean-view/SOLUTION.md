## Intuition
The algorithm efficiently identifies the buildings that can view the sea by using a monotonic decreasing stack. It iterates through the buildings, updating the stack to maintain the decreasing order of heights. The resulting stack contains the indices of the buildings that can view the sea.

## Approach

The algorithm uses a monotonic decreasing stack to efficiently identify the buildings that can view the sea. It iterates through the `heights` array, maintaining a stack that stores the indices of the buildings. The stack stores indices in such a way that the heights are in decreasing order. This ensures that when a new building is encountered, it pops elements from the stack until a smaller height is found or the stack becomes empty.

1. *Monotonic Stack*: Use a stack to store the indices of buildings in decreasing order of heights.
2. *Iterate Through Buildings*: Iterate through the `heights` array.
3. *Update Stack if necessary*: While the stack is not empty and the current building's height is greater than or equal to the height of the building at the top of the stack, pop elements from the stack.
4. 4.*Append Current Index to Stack*: After the update, append the current index to the stack.
5. *Result*: The stack contains the indices of buildings that can view the sea.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the `heights` array. The algorithm iterates through each building once. 

- Space complexity: $O(N)$
The space complexity is O(N) in the worst case, where N is the length of the `heights` array. The stack can contain all elements of the array in the worst case.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # for building b, sea(b) if height(b) > height(x) for all x to right of b
        # sorted in increasing order is important
        # stack - left to right.
        stack = []

        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[i] >= heights[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            
            stack.append(i)
        
        return stack
```
