## Intuition

The problem involves determining whether it's possible to make a given string a palindrome by removing at most one character.

## Approach

The algorithm checks for the palindrome property of the string while allowing at most one character to be removed. It uses a helper function `valid` to check if a given string is a palindrome.

1. **Palindrome Check Function**: Define a function `valid` that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. The function uses two pointers (`start` and `end`) to compare characters from both ends of the string. If a mismatch is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Main Function**: Initialize two pointers (`start` and `end`) at the beginning and end of the input string `s`.

3. **Palindrome Check and Removal**: While `start` is less than `end`, check if the characters at positions `start` and `end` are equal. If they are not equal, try removing either the character at `start` or `end` and check if the resulting substring is a palindrome using the `valid` function. Else, keep incrementing start and decrementing end.

4. **Return Result**: If the entire string can be made into a palindrome by removing at most one character, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

The algorithm returns `True` if the given string can be made into a palindrome by removing at most one character; otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N)$

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. The algorithm iterates through the string once.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$
The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for pointers (`start` and `end`).

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

        def valid(string: str) -> bool:
            start = 0
            end = len(string) - 1

            while start < end:
                if string[start] != string[end]:
                    return False
                start+=1
                end-=1   
            return True
        
        start = 0
        end = len(s) - 1

        while start < end:
            if s[start] != s[end]:
                return valid(s[start+1: end+1]) or valid(s[start:end])
            start+=1
            end-=1
        return True
```
