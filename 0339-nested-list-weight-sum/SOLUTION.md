## Intuition

The problem involves calculating the sum of nested integers in a nested list, where each integer's contribution to the sum is weighted by its depth in the nested structure. The problems directly mentions tracking the "depth" of the nested integers. This leads t the intuition that we need to conduct a depth-first-search. 

## Approach

The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the nested list. It recursively calculates the sum of integers, taking into account their depth in the nested structure. 

We iterate over the initial nested list.

1. **Base Case**: If the current element is an integer, add its value to the total multiplied by the current depth.
2. **Recursive Case**: If the current element is a nested list, recursively call the `depthSum` function on that nested list with an incremented depth.
3. **Accumulate Total**: Accumulate the totals obtained from the base and recursive cases.

The algorithm returns the sum of nested integers weighted by their depth.



## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of integers in the nested list. The algorithm traverses each element once.

- Space complexity: $O(D)$
The space complexity is O(D), where D is the maximum depth of the nested structure. The recursion stack depth is limited by the depth of the nested structure.

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
