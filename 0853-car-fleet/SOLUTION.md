## Intuition

The algorithm uses a two-step process. 

First, it combines the position and speed data into a list of pairs, which is then sorted based on the initial positions in descending order. 

Next, it calculates the time each car takes to reach the target. A list with times of different fleets is tracked. If a car's time to reach the target is greater than the time of the fleet ahead of it (last element in the list), a new fleet is formed, and this car's time is added to the list. This process continues until all cars are considered. 

The result is the length of the list of times, as each time represents a different fleet. 

## Approach

1. Create a list `data` to store pairs of position and speed.
2. Iterate through the input lists `position` and `speed`, populating the `data` list with pairs.
3. Sort the `data` list based on the initial positions in descending order.
4. Initialize a list `times` to store the time each car takes to reach the target.
5. Iterate through the sorted `data` list, calculating the time for each car to reach the target.
6. If the `times` list is empty or the last recorded time in `times` is less than the calculated time, append the time to `times`.
7. Return the length of the `times` list, representing the number of car fleets formed.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N*log(N))$
The time complexity is O(N log N), where N is the length of the input lists `position` and `speed`. The dominant factor is the sorting operation.

- Space complexity: $O(N)$

The space complexity is O(N), where N is total the number of cars. The algorithm uses additional space to store the `data` list and the `times` list.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        data = []
        times = []

        for i in range(len(position)):
            data.append([position[i], speed[i]])
        
        data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse = True)

        for p, s in data:
            time = (target-p) / s
            
            if not times or times[-1] < time:
                times.append(time)
        
        return len(times)
