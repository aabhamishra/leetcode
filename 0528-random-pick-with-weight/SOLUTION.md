## Intuition

The algorithm efficiently selects an index with a probability proportional to its weight by using a prefix sum array and performing binary search. The binary search ensures logarithmic time complexity, making the algorithm suitable for cases with a large number of elements.

## Approach

The algorithm uses the prefix sum array to represent the cumulative weights. It initializes the prefix sum array in the constructor and uses binary search to find the index corresponding to a randomly chosen weight in the `pickIndex` method.

1. **Constructor**: In the constructor, initialize the prefix sum array (`prefix`) as the cumulative sum of weights. The `prefix` array is used to map a randomly chosen weight to its corresponding index.

2. **Pick Index Method**: In the `pickIndex` method, generate a random weight using `Random.nextInt(prefix[len - 1]) + 1`, where `prefix[len - 1]` is the total sum of weights. Perform a binary search on the `prefix` array to find the index corresponding to the chosen weight.

3. **Binary Search Helper**: The `binarySearch` method performs a binary search to find the index of the first element in the `prefix` array greater than or equal to the given weight.

The algorithm returns the index of an element with a probability proportional to its weight.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    - Constructor: $O(N)$, where N is the length of the input array `w`. The constructor initializes the prefix sum array by iterating through the array once.
    - `pickIndex` method: $O(log N)$, where N is the length of the input array `w`. The binary search efficiently finds the index corresponding to the randomly chosen weight.
- Space complexity $O(N)$
O(N), where N is the length of the input array `w`. The algorithm uses additional space to store the prefix sum array.

## Code
```python
class Solution {
    int[] prefix;
    int len;
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        // array of prefix sums
        len = w.length;
        prefix = new int[len];
        prefix[0] = w[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i];
        }
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        Random r = new Random();
        return binarySearch(r.nextInt(prefix[len-1]) + 1);
    }

    private int binarySearch(int num) {
        int start = 0, end = len - 1;

        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;

            if(prefix[mid] < num) {
                start = mid+1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }

        return start;
    }
}
