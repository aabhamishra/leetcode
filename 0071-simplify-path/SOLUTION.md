## Intuition

The problem involves simplifying a given absolute Unix-style file path, which consists of directories separated by a forward slash (/). The simplification involves removing unnecessary components such as consecutive slashes, current directory references (.), and redundant parent directory references (..).

The algorithm efficiently simplifies the given Unix-style file path by utilizing a stack-based approach. It iterates through the components of the path, selectively processing each component based on its nature. By maintaining a stack to keep track of the directories encountered, it constructs the simplified path without unnecessary components.

## Approach

The algorithm simplifies the path by splitting it into components and using a stack to keep track of the directories encountered.

1. **Path Splitting**: Split the input path string `path` into an array of components using the forward slash (/) as the delimiter.

2. **Stack-Based Processing**: Iterate through the components of the path.
    - If the current component is a no-op (empty string or '.'), ignore it.
    - If the current component is '..', pop the top directory from the stack if it's non-empty (i.e., to go up one level).
    - If the current component is a directory name, push it onto the stack.
    
3. **Result Construction**: Join the directories in the stack with forward slashes to construct the simplified path.

4. **Return Result**: Return the simplified path, ensuring it starts with a forward slash (/).

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(N)$
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input path string `path`. The algorithm iterates through each character of the path and performs constant-time operations.

- Space complexity: $O(N)$
The space complexity is O(N).

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        arr = path.split("/")
        stack = []
        for i in arr:
            # no-op
            if i == "." or i == "":
                continue
            # go up a level if level exists
            elif i == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            # file name encountered
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
